## Abstract<a name="abstract"></a>
This project aims to develop a delivery system for our robocar that can detect and follow humans while also incorporating a stopping mechanism to prevent collisions. Additionally, the robot will utilize facial recognition to identify individuals and personalize interactions.

## Part 1: Hardware<a name="part-1-hardware"></a>

## Part 2: Human Detection and Following with Depthai and PyVesc <a name="part-2-human-detection-and-following-with-depthai-and-pyvesc"></a>
The OAKD camera will be used to detect and track humans in the robot's vicinity. The PyVesc motor controllers will then be used to move the robot in the direction of the detected human.

## Part 3: Stopping Mechanism with Lidar<a name="part-3-stopping-mechanism-with-lidar"></a> 
The Lidar sensor will be used to detect obstacles in the robot's path. If an obstacle is detected, the robot will stop moving and wait for the obstacle to clear before continuing on its path.

## Part 4: Facial Recognition<a name="part-4-facial-recognition"></a>  
The robot will be equipped with a facial recognition system, using a webcam, that will allow it to identify individuals and personalize interactions. Once it recognizes the right person, the delivery box will open.
